mew

it will be a package manager translator initally
for eg i am a debian user and very comfertable with apt but not wanna use pacman commands on arch 
so for eg : i use mew on arch 
like
$ mew apt-get install VLC
it will be translated to 
Pacman -S VLC

or for eg i use mewtwo on ubuntu

$mewtwo install VLC
it will be translated to

apt-get install VLC

it will translate package manager commands to the native package manager command of the distro 


different package manager commands to be used --> check commands.md
