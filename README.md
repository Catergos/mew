# mew
### it will be a package manager translator initally
### WHY
if i have to temporaly use another OS but i have no time to see what their commands are or check them 

### What it will do ?
Instead of remembering various options/tools on different OSs, you only need a common way to manipulate packages. Not all options of the native package manager are ported; the tool only provides a very basic interface to search, install, remove packages, and/or update the system initally. (currently noting is working)

>>>>>>> master
for eg i am a debian user and very comfertable with apt but not wanna use pacman commands on arch 
so for eg : i use mew on arch 
like
$ mew apt-get install VLC
it will be translated to 
Pacman -S VLC

or for eg i use mew on ubuntu

$mew install VLC
it will be translated to

apt-get install VLC

it will translate package manager commands to the native package manager command of the distro

## Plans to implement the following package managers: (non linux OS will be done at last second priority will be BSD)

* pacman by Arch Linux, ArchBang, Manjaro, etc.
* dpkg/apt-get by Debian, Ubuntu, etc.
* homebrew by Mac OS X
* macports by Mac OS X
* yum/rpm by Redhat, CentOS, Fedora, etc.
* portage by Gentoo
* zypper by OpenSUSE
* pkgng by FreeBSD
* cave by Exherbo Linux
* pkg_tools by OpenBSD
* sun_tools by Solaris(SunOS)
* apk by Alpine Linux
* tazpkg by SliTaz Linux
