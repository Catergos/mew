//Mew module loader
/*
This file is intended to be a starting point. This is development demonstration
only. Required modules for other OS's package manager's should ideally be 
implemented in seperate .c files, and provided seperately during release

//Creates an AST that is used to determine the typed command's package manager
*/

//TODO :-

//Currently: Find a way of implementing AST's that's not hideously expensive
//*Share memoru b/w multiple modules?
//*Or implement in a single file?
